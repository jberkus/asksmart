# On how to answer questions

* If you don't know the answer, don't say anything at all.

* If you don't want to help the asker, don't say anything at all.

* If you don't think the querent is worthy of your time, don't say anything at all.

It is not your job to make the querent see the error of his ways.

It is not your job to enforce your own guidelines for who you will
help on the entire support mechanism.

Don't assume the worst of the questioner.

* If you run out of patience, just walk away.  Don't yell at the querent.

* Don't assume that he hasn't read the docs.

* Don't assume he is lazy.

* Don't assign moral failure because if he hasn't.

* RTFM means that you know where the FM is.

* It's unreasonable to expect that everyone else will have read all the things you have.

* After you've helped someone get to the bottom of their question,
then restate it back to them and ask "Is that what you're asking?"
