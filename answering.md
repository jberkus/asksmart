# On how to answer questions

* If you don't know the answer, don't say anything at all.

* If you don't want to help the asker, don't say anything at all.

* If you don't think the querent is worthy of your time, don't say anything at all.

It is not your job to make the querent see the error of his ways.

It is not your job to enforce your own guidelines for who you will
help on the entire support mechanism.
