Sometimes you need help with a computer problem.  Maybe it's how
to use a piece of software, or you can't figure out why your hardware
is acting flaky.  You want to ask for help, and that's good.  The
Internet is a great resource for getting help from your fellow
humans.

But you should put some thought into how to ask.  You'll increase
your chances of getting help, you'll get help faster, and you'll
get better help.

# Do your research first

The very fastest way to get the answer you seek is probably to find
it on the Web yourself.

Chances are, you're not the first person to have this problem.
Chances are, someone else has had this exact problem and it's been
posted somewhere on the Web.

The easiest way to find the answer to the question you want is just
to type the question directly into Google.  Maybe you're wondering
"I heard someone mention that you could do it, so I wonder how can
I get my git repository status in my bash prompt?"  So go to Google
and type in "how can I get my git repository status in my bash
prompt?"  Just like that.  And now you have a
[page of possible answers][git-shell].


Maybe all those pages don't apply to you, because they're mostly
about zsh and you're using bash, so change "shell" to "bash" and
[try it again][git-bash].  Now you've narrowed your search and you
have ten excellent sources of help.

[git-shell]: https://www.google.com/search?q=how+can+I+get+my+git+repository+status+in+my+shell+prompt%3F
[git-bash]: https://www.google.com/search?q=how+can+I+get+my+git+repository+status+in+my+bash+prompt%3F

In half a minute, you've found the answer you need, and it's more
complete than someone making an *ad hoc* answer on a mailing list
or in IRC.

## Use more words when searching

The more words you throw at Google, the better its answers come
back.  Don't worry about trying to whittle it down to only the most
important keywords, like "git status bash prompt".  Use full
sentences!  Asking a question in your search makes it more likely
you'll find a page with someone asking that question.
